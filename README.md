# c-db-server
A torture of an assignment that I rather no one go though T_T

A simple C DB server that was part of a university assignment.

It performs basic CRUD operations but not as sophisticated as using Insert Where.

Operational things can be found inside the zip fie uploaded. Copy away but learn what happens inside as well.
